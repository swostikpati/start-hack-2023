# 💸 FinVerse - START Hack 2023

Globally, only 1-in-3 adults are 'financially literate'. Access to financial data and financial data insights are often presented in ways that are boring and difficult to interpret for the average user. Our mission is to make financial data easier to *interpret, interact, understand* and *visualize*.

Presenting [FinVerse](https://six-cutting-edge.streamlit.app/), a VR financial literacy platform developed during the START Hack 2023.

## 📌 How to run
- Go to [https://six-cutting-edge.streamlit.app/](https://six-cutting-edge.streamlit.app/)
- Pick companies you are investing in or would like to compare with each other
- Click on the "Generate VR world" button
- Dive into the immersive finverse to see the visualization of how they are faring in the financial world
- **Tips:** Use a headset or go fullscreen on your laptop to get the full experience

## ⚙️ How does it work?
We connect to a live stream of market data and End of Day (EoD) prices using [SIX](https://www.six-group.com/en/home.html)'s financial APIs and link it to an interactive, **scalable** VR environment.

Users can walk through their portfolio by choosing designated companies and witness how their empire rises firsthand.

Taller buildings correspond to companies with a higher average value.
Rising lights mean the company's EoD prices have increased compared to the previous day
Dimming/lowering lights link to a decrease of the company's EoD prices.
